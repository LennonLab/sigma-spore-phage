RAxML-NG was called at 04-Sep-2021 13:10:35 as follows:

raxml-ng --bootstrap --msa /N/u/danschw/Carbonate/GitHub/sigma-spore-phage/phylo/data/align-trim-tree/check_msa/parse-msa.raxml.rba --model LG+G4 --prefix /N/u/danschw/Carbonate/GitHub/sigma-spore-phage/phylo/data/align-trim-tree/tree/bootstraps/bs70 --seed 707070 --threads 4 --tree rand{5} --bs-trees 5

Analysis options:
  run mode: Bootstrapping
  start tree(s): random (5)
  bootstrap replicates: 5
  random seed: 707070
  tip-inner: OFF
  pattern compression: ON
  per-rate scalers: OFF
  site repeats: ON
  branch lengths: proportional (ML estimate, algorithm: NR-FAST)
  SIMD kernels: AVX2
  parallelization: PTHREADS (4 threads), thread pinning: OFF

WARNING: The model you specified on the command line (LG+G4) will be ignored 
         since the binary MSA file already contains a model definition.
         If you want to change the model, please re-run RAxML-NG 
         with the original PHYLIP/FASTA alignment and --redo option.
